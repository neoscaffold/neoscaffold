# TODO:

- integrate nodes that provide the "chat" interface in a capacity similar to the a chat persona
- the chat should have a clear api that interfaces with other nodes
- the chat interface should be capable of both accepting inputs and providing outputs if the user interacts with it
- the js widget should be expandable and have a "full screen" mode that allows the user to interact with the chat interface in a more immersive way
- a goal for this would be to replicate the chat interface that has been successful elsewhere
- consider using the standard openai chat completions interface in addition to features like streaming and agentic tool use
- reference the user interface and ideas in metagptx by deepwisdom.ai
